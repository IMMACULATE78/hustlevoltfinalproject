## 🚀 What is HustleVault?

HustleVault is a web platform designed to help African freelancers succeed in the global gig economy. It gives them curated freelance jobs, downloadable proposal and CV templates, skill-building guides, and a secure workflow that ensures they get paid for their work.

Many freelancers face poor job options, unfair pay, and unreliable platforms. HustleVault bridges that gap — not with more noise, but with real support, direction, and tools that build confidence.

## 🧠 How It Works

When a freelancer submits work on a job:
1. It’s marked as **Pending Review**
2. An **admin reviews the work**
3. Once approved, it’s marked as **Completed**
4. Then, the system marks it as **“Payment Released”**

This helps simulate an **escrow-style system** that builds trust — without needing real-time payment integrations in the MVP.
